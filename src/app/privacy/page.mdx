At **JEEPedia**, your privacy matters. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle data when you use our app.

## 1. No Personal Data Collection

We do **not collect**, store, or share any personally identifiable information (PII). You can use JEEPedia without providing any personal details like name, email, or phone number.

## 2. Anonymous Analytics

To help us improve the app and understand general usage patterns, we use **anonymous analytics**. These analytics tools collect **non-personal, aggregated data** such as:
- Feature usage (e.g., which pages are visited)
- Crash reports and error logs
- Device type and OS version

This data **cannot be used to identify you** and is used solely for debugging and improving the app experience.

## 3. No Third-Party Ads or Trackers

JEEPedia does **not use any third-party advertising libraries** or invasive trackers. We donâ€™t share any analytics data with advertisers.

## 4. Offline-Friendly

Most of JEEPedia works offline. When you do go online (e.g., to fetch the latest cutoffs), only **non-identifiable requests** are sent â€” no user profile or data is transmitted.

## 5. Childrenâ€™s Privacy

JEEPedia is safe for users of all ages. Since we do not collect personal information, the app complies with child privacy protections such as COPPA and GDPR-K.

## 6. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected here with a revised **"Effective Date"**.
